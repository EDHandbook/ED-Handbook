## Chamberlain's Rest

Chamberlain's Rest is called a "planetary station" in the game. This is the station where you will start the actual part of your game at. Chamberlain's Rest is located in the HIP 97950 system, a permit locked system that is a part of the Pilot's Federation starter systems.

At most space stations, you will find a lounge. In Elite: Dangerous, these lounges are referred to as "Concourse". Concourses across all stations will have indentical services, although some only have access to certain services. Let's look at what services this station has to offer!
