# Encoded Materials

Encoded materials can be obtained from scanning anything that emits an emission. Examples of anything that transmits these emission type signals can be Wake Signal Sources, Encoded Emissions, and from scanning data points and security beacons. Encoded telemetry are rarer to find as there are not a lot of resources that encoded materials can be obtained from. 

## Jameson Crashed Site

The most popular site to visit to collect encoded materials from is Jameson's Crashed Site. A short visitation with a datalink scanner will yield you enough encoded resources.

    Jameson Crashed Site is as the name suggest, a planetary point of interest, featuring the pilot CMDR Jameson at which you piloted as this character in Frontier: First Encounters. The Crashed site has 9 scannable data points.(1)

        !!! tip "SRV is not Required!"

            You can scan all 9 data points without the need of an SRV, contrary to popular belief. As long as you choose a ship where the cockpit is relatively in the front of the ship, then you can use the ship's on-board data link scanner utility to scan all 9 data points.
