    ---

    Our mission is to document everything Elite Dangerous to any community that may need our resources. We try to keep our guides beginner-friendly, simple, and straightforward. The Pilot’s Handbook’s goal is to decrease the difficulty of Elite Dangerous’ steep learning curve. We also aim to keep our guides short to make sure we do not overwhelm the reader with excess information. With help from various communities, we hope to give accurate, up-to-date information. 
    
    :octicons-dash-24: From the Pilot’s Handbook Team, we hope to serve you all.
